# Predictive Analytics Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the predictive analytics components implemented in the Marketing Analytics Dashboard.

## Predictive Analytics Models

### Customer Acquisition/ Revenue/ Ad Spend Prediction
- **Purpose**: Forecast customer acquisition, revenue, and the impact of ad spend to optimize marketing budgets and strategies.
- **Model Type**: Time Series Forecasting
- **Framework**: Prophet
- **Features**:
  - Historical marketing spend- Total marketing spend across different channels
  - Seasonal factors - Temporal patterns like holidays (accounted for in Prophet)
  - Campaign performance indicators - Derived fields such as (cost per acquired customer)
- **Output**: Predicted customer acquisition rates, revenue, or optimal ad spend allocation for future periods.

### ROI Analytics
- **Purpose**: Conduct descriptive analysis to identify and highlight the top-performing marketing channels based on historical data.
- **Model Type**: Descriptive Analysis
- **Features**:
  - Marketing spend by channel
  - Historical conversion rates
  - Historical revenue
- **Output**: Visual representation (e.g., dashboards, charts) of top-performing channels based on ROI, conversion efficiency

## Model Training Pipeline

### Data Preprocessing
1. Data cleaning and normalization
2. Feature engineering
3. Time series alignment

### Training Process
1. Model selection and validation (Prophet vs LSTM vs Arima/Arimax)
2. Hyperparameter tuning
3. Cross-validation
4. Performance metrics tracking (MAPE/ RMSE)

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Model Monitoring
- Prediction accuracy tracking
- Drift detection
- Performance metrics
- Error logging

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
- REST API endpoints
- Error handling
- Loading states

### Backend Integration
- Data pipeline integration
- Security measures

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Input validation
- Access control
