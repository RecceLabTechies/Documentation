# System Architecture Documentation

## 1. Overview
The backend system is a Flask-based REST API application that follows a modular architecture pattern. It's designed to handle data processing, user management, and provides various services through a well-structured API.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Application Layer
- **Flask Application**: The main application framework (`app.py`)
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration through `config.py`
- **CORS Support**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing enabled for frontend integration
- **Logging System**: Custom logging configuration for application monitoring

### 2.2 Data Layer
- **Database Management**: MongoDB integration through `pymongo`
- **Data Models**: Structured data types defined in `data_types.py`
- **Database Connection**: Managed through a singleton pattern in `database/connection.py`

### 2.3 Service Layer
- **Route Handlers**: Organized in blueprints (`routes/`)
  - User routes (`user_routes.py`)
  - Data routes (`data_routes.py`)
- **Business Logic**: Implemented in `services/` directory
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions in `utils/` directory

## 3. Key Dependencies
- **Web Framework**: Flask 3.1.0
- **Database**: MongoDB (via pymongo 4.11.3)
- **Data Processing**: 
  - pandas 2.2.3
  - numpy 2.2.4
  - scikit-learn 1.6.1
- **Time Series Analysis**: 
  - prophet 1.1.6
  - statsmodels 0.14.4
- **API Security**: flask-cors 5.0.1

## 4. Architecture Patterns
- **Modular Design**: Components are organized into separate modules
- **Blueprint Pattern**: Route organization using Flask blueprints
- **Singleton Pattern**: Database connection management
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Separation of business logic from route handlers

## 5. Data Flow
1. **Request Handling**:
   - Incoming requests are routed through Flask blueprints
   - CORS middleware handles cross-origin requests
   - Request validation and processing

2. **Business Logic**:
   - Service layer processes the requests
   - Database operations are performed through the database connection
   - Data transformation and processing as needed

3. **Response Generation**:
   - Processed data is formatted
   - Responses are sent back to the client

## 6. Security Considerations
- CORS configuration for controlled cross-origin access
- Maximum content length restrictions for file uploads
- Structured logging for monitoring and debugging

## 7. Scalability Features
- Modular architecture allows for easy component scaling
- Database connection pooling through pymongo
- Efficient data processing with pandas and numpy

## 8. Development and Deployment
- Docker support for containerization
- Environment configuration through `environment.yml`
- Comprehensive testing setup in `tests/` directory
- Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and experimentation

## 9. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Structured logging system
- Error handling and reporting
- Database connection management
- Performance monitoring capabilities
