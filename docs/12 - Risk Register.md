# Project Risk Register

## Technical Risks

### 1. System Performance
**Risk Level: High**
- **Description:** Performance might be limited as more users onboard and use the service concurrently.
- **Impact:** 
  - System slowdown
  - Poor user experience
  - Potential system crashes under heavy load
- **Mitigation Strategy:** 
  - **Note: Due to demo nature and budget constraints, the following mitigations will NOT be implemented:**
    - Load balancer implementation
    - Multiple backend servers
  - **Instead, we will:**
    - Clearly document performance limitations in demo
    - Limit concurrent users during demonstration
    - Set clear expectations with stakeholders about performance constraints
    - Include performance improvement recommendations in future development plans
- **Status:** Accepted risk for demo phase

### 2. Performance/Cost Management
**Risk Level: High**
- **Description:** As more data is stored on the system, it may result in:
  - Memory issues
  - Slower querying
  - High bills
- **Impact:**
  - Degraded system performance
  - Increased operational costs
  - Limited data processing capability
- **Mitigation Strategy:** 
  - **Note: Due to demo nature and budget constraints, the following will NOT be implemented:**
    - Advanced archiving strategy
    - Tiered storage solutions
    - Premium storage options
  - **Instead, we will:**
    - Implement data size limits for demo
    - Regularly clean up test data
    - Document storage limitations clearly
    - Provide recommendations for production-scale implementation
- **Status:** Accepted risk for demo phase

### 3. LLM Accuracy
**Risk Level: Low**
- **Description:**
  - Hallucination of LLM in terms of description generation
  - LLM may be less accurate in choosing the correct dataset for generation
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - Use LLM with more parameters
  - Implement a data understanding pipeline
  - Process and update ingested datasets with better headers
  - Enable user-added table descriptions powered by LLM during dataset upload
- **Status:** Ongoing monitoring and improvement

### 4. Model Accuracy
**Risk Level: Medium**
- **Description:** Time series forecasting by ARIMA/ARIMAX may not be the most accurate due to weak seasonality in the data
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - Implement automated retraining pipeline
  - Rerun data preprocessing and ML model pipeline for new data uploads
  - Dynamic model selection based on best hyperparameters
  - Maximize data fit by including new data
- **Status:** Regular model evaluation required

## Risk Management Process

### Monitoring and Review
1. Weekly review of system performance metrics
2. Regular assessment of data storage costs
3. Continuous monitoring of LLM accuracy
4. Periodic model performance evaluation

### Response Planning

1. **LLM Quality:**
   - Regular accuracy assessments
   - User feedback collection
   - Continuous model improvements

2. **Model Accuracy:**
   - Regular model evaluation
   - Data quality assessments
   - Alternative model research


## Action Items

1. **Ongoing Monitoring:**
   - Daily performance checks
   - Weekly cost analysis
   - Bi-weekly LLM accuracy review
   - Weekly model performance evaluation


# Additional Project Risks

## 1. Data Security & Privacy Risks
**Risk Level: High**
- **Description:**
  - Potential unauthorized access to sensitive marketing data
  - Data breaches during transmission or storage
  - Compliance issues with data protection regulations
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - **Note: As this is a demo version, full security measures will NOT be implemented**
  - Basic authentication for demo purposes only
  - Use of test/dummy data where possible
  - Clear documentation stating security limitations
- **Status:** Accepted risk for demo phase

## 2. Technical Integration Risks
**Risk Level: Medium**
- **Description:**
  - Integration challenges between frontend and backend systems
  - API compatibility issues
  - Database synchronization problems
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - Comprehensive integration testing
  - Maintain detailed API documentation
  - Regular system health checks

## 3. Data Quality Risks
**Risk Level: High**
- **Description:**
  - Inconsistent data formats from different sources
  - Missing or incomplete data
  - Data drift over time
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - Implement robust data validation
  - Regular data quality assessments
  - Automated data cleaning pipelines


## 4. Resource Risks
**Risk Level: Medium**
- **Description:**
  - Team member availability
  - Technical skill gaps
  - Knowledge transfer challenges
- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - Cross-training team members
  - Documentation of critical processes
  - Regular knowledge sharing sessions



## Additional Action Items


1. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Daily security checks
   - Weekly integration testing
   - Monthly compliance review
   - Bi-weekly user adoption metrics
