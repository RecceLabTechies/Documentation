# Security Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document details the security architecture, measures, and best practices implemented in the RecceLabs LLM Dashboard. It covers authentication flows, data protection, infrastructure security, and monitoring practices.

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Initial Authentication

- User submits credentials (email/password) via login form
- Backend validates credentials against MongoDB
- Upon successful validation:
  - User data stored in localStorage for client-side access
  - Authentication token (base64 encoded user data) set in HTTP-only cookie
  - Token includes username and email information
  - Cookie set with 7-day expiration

### 2. Route Protection (Next.js Middleware)

- Middleware intercepts all requests to protected routes
- Checks for presence of 'auth-token' cookie
- Public routes (`/`, `/login`) accessible without authentication
- Authenticated users redirected from public routes to `/dashboard`
- Unauthenticated users redirected to login page
- Route matcher configured for specific paths (`/`, `/dashboard/:path*`)

### 3. Session Management

- Cookie-based session tracking
- Server-side validation of auth token
- Automatic session expiration after 7 days
- Client-side state management with localStorage

## Security Measures

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based token authentication
- HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- Role-based access control (root/member roles)
- Protected route middleware
- Session timeout mechanisms
- Secure password handling

### 2. Data Protection

- Input validation using Zod schema
- Email format verification
- Password length restrictions
- Form data sanitization
- Case normalization for emails
- Trimmed input values

### 3. Frontend Security

- Client-side form validation
- Error message sanitization
- Loading state management
- Protected route navigation
- Secure credential handling
- CSRF protection via tokens

### 4. API Security

- Request validation
- Error handling and logging
- Rate limiting
- CORS protection
- Request size limits
- Secure headers

### 5. Infrastructure Security

- Container isolation
- Environment variable protection
- Nginx reverse proxy
- SSL/TLS termination
- Network segmentation
- Service-specific ports

### 6. Error Handling

- Graceful error recovery
- User-friendly error messages
- Secure error logging
- Failed login attempt handling
- Session recovery mechanisms

### 7. Monitoring & Auditing

- Authentication attempt logging
- Access log monitoring
- Error tracking
- Security event logging
- User activity tracking
- Real-time alerts

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Password Security

- Minimum length requirements
- Complexity validation
- Secure storage
- Hashing mechanisms
- Salt implementation

### 2. Session Security

- Secure cookie flags
- Session timeout
- Token rotation
- Concurrent session handling
- Logout mechanisms

### 3. API Security

- Authentication headers
- Request validation
- Response sanitization
- Error handling
- Rate limiting

### 4. Infrastructure

- Regular security updates
- Dependency scanning
- Container security
- Network policies
- Access controls

## Security Incident Response

### 1. Detection

- Automated monitoring systems
- Log analysis
- Anomaly detection
- User reports
- Security alerts

### 2. Response Procedures

- Immediate containment actions
- Investigation process
- Evidence collection
- Stakeholder notification
- System recovery

### 3. Prevention

- Regular security audits
- Vulnerability assessments
- Penetration testing
- Security training
- Policy updates

## Compliance and Regulations

### 1. Data Protection

- User data handling
- Privacy policies
- Data retention
- Access controls
- Encryption standards

### 2. Audit Trail

- System access logs
- Change management
- Security events
- User activities
- Configuration changes

## Security Updates and Maintenance

### 1. Regular Updates

- Security patches
- Dependency updates
- Configuration reviews
- Policy updates
- Documentation maintenance

### 2. Security Testing

- Automated security testing
- Manual penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Configuration validation
- Access control verification
